// Re-export shim — NOTHING is declared here. Every shape the app reads off the IPC wire is declared
// once, in src/wire.ts (the generated S7 contract), and surfaced here under the import path feature
// code has always used.
//
// The Rust-mirroring shapes (Project, AppConfig, the session/browse shapes) moved into wire.ts with
// the `Commands` catalogue: the catalogue needs a result type for every command, and a second copy
// here would be free to drift from the one the catalogue pins. The TS↔Rust side of those shapes is
// still a hand-mirror of the serde structs in src-tauri — see the note in wire.ts.
